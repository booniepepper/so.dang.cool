# Hello world!

I'm J.R. and this is where I'm putting some of my thinks and scribbles. Mostly
it will be concerned with computers and software. The content will range from
notes to myself up to manifestos on how I think _it ought to be done._

Thanks for stopping by, I hope you find something of interest!
