I decided to start keeping a blog (diary? notes?) because I had this thought today:

> Probably the greatest thoughts have been forgotten. No one bothered to write them down.

Then I also had this thought:

> I have a lot of thoughts, and probably at some point one of them will be great.

Also, and this is completely changing the subject, but today I realized something that all the people I ever met named Richard share one attribute.

Now I like to think of myself as an inclusive person. I try to show favor to minorities. I suppose it's because for most settings and phases of my life I've also been a minority. Sometimes this is a minority along some of the "standard" dividing lines of our time. Gender, race, etc. Other times a minority along dividing lines I don't hear discussed as much. Political/religious affiliations (or lack thereof), interests, culture, personality, general weirdness, etc. I do tick a lot of boxes for what is considered majority in my culture, so I suppose take that all with a grain of salt.

Anyhow, I don't think less of a person based on their beliefs or attributes or even personality (even if they're downright mean!). This goes for Richards of all sorts as well. I also remain open to challenge, and would be happy to be disproven. I may be generalizing *my experiences* with Richards to the name, or may have forgotten a Richard that doesn't follow the pattern.

It's odd to me that a name would be such a predictor, because it does transcend a lot of more important (in my opinion) attributes. That said I realized today that every Richard I've ever met has been a Dick.
