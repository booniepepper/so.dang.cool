# Projects

## Applications

[Sigi](https://github.com/hiljusti/sigi)

Sigi is a command line todo application. It's also a naive implementation of a
stack-based database. Sigi is implemented in Rust.

## Libraries

[Z](https://github.com/hiljusti/z)

Z is a Java library for bold, exciting, and fearless function combination. It
allows for point-free programming without getting bogged down in lots of
functional programming idioms and concepts. I hope you find it concise and
accessible!

## Polyglot adventures

The following are solutions to some online challenges. Sometimes challenges get updated, so these may become out of date but were working at the time of commit.

These are intended as a learning resource. Please don't cheat yourself out of learning. More sites and more languages to come.
