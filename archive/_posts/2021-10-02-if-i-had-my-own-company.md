This is just a small collection of my own preferences. These are probably
not your preferences, and probably not exactly the same as everyone. Some
are inspired by the advice above, and others are unique to my personality.
I believe someone could have completely opposite preferences and lead a
content and fulfilled life.

- Be unemployed. No "boss," no shareholders, no venture capital stakeholders,
  no advertisers, no open lines of credit to banks.

- Make things. No "personality is the product," no complex schemes, no indirect
  revenue streams (e.g. advertisement).

- Don't grow "the platform." Large influence on peoples' behavior and beliefs is not important.

- Don't grow "the company." Large number of employees is not important.

- Don't grow "the profit margin." Large profit per "thing" is not important.
  It's ok to sell at reasonable prices, it's ok to have free versions, it's
  ok and important to have products that are not monetized at all.

- Do grow "the value." Focus on the value of the product. Focus on making
  products of higher quality and usefulness.
