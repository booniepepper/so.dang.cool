        It was written in ActionScript 3 (Flash), but these days, it's not
        possible to embed Flash in a web page anymore.</p>
      <p>
        If you want to try this out, your best bet is to download an offline
        Flash player (requires ActionScript 3) and then download
        <a href="tiny-puppy-rpg.swf">tiny-puppy-rpg.swf</a> and run it.
