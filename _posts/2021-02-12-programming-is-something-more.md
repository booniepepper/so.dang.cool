Rasmus Lerdorf (the Danish-Canadian creator of the "unmentionable" PHP) once said "I don't
really like programming. I built [PHP] to program less so that I could just reuse code."

Whether PHP has caused people to program more or less may be up for debate. I for one think he
succeeded based on the successes of WordPress, Joomla, Drupal and the like. There is a massive
following of the non-computer-science-savvy that happen to do just fine with it. They may not
know heaps and stacks and inverting a binary tree (yawn, [left, right] = [right, left]) but
many a small business and many a family has lived off of this legacy.

I'm also skeptical about the gatekeeping and superiority people might feel from having chosen
some different language. (Side note: We'll probably feel that language is ugly and full of 
bad ideas and generally unmentionable 15 years from now too.)

But, PHP aside, I think he also touches on a deeper point. I think the truest programmers, the
tinkerers and hackers that change the world, may also not really like programming. I think we
think we love programming but it might not be that simple.

Remember back to a simpler time in your life, when your work was measurable in numbers and not
trust and influence. Remember back when you flipped burgers, or worked in a call center, or just
got "graded" on your work in school. Did you love that? What if that's what programming was?

Imagine a world where the hard problems are solved. Imagine a world where you go to work each
day to do work that you have done before. Write another proxy, write another cache. Complete
repetition, no challenge, but come on, you can get those numbers up a little this month right?

I think that would be attractive to some. A sweet release from a never-ending onslaught of new
technology with lacking documentation, problems that seem simple to state but require
Herculean effort to fix, or the ever present thing you've done in code and don't know how it
worked and are terrified it might stop working and you need to face it yet again.

Perhaps, attractive to us all at some times.

But, I submit, those of us that are in programming because we love programming (at least, so we
say) would not actually like to be always programming. We probably like the chaos, and enjoy
slaying the enormous dragons that masquerade as stray dogs, and are a little excited to have
another bout with that shifty demon we keep know is lurking.

In a sense, I suppose that is programming. That at least is what we mean, a little, when we say
programming. But it's also something more. Don't give up the fight.
