The country of USA, and also the world climate in general, feels like it's on the verge of something new.

I'm a follower of Jesus, which I think is different from what "Christian" has come to mean in these parts. Anyway, I woke up very early this morning trying to imagine what it would be like if those who claimed to be Christian loved their enemies. I'm still trying to imagine it, but I find it very difficult.
